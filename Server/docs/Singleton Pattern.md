### **Understanding JavaScript Class Export Patterns**

In JavaScript, particularly with ES Modules, how you export and import a class determines whether you work with its blueprint (the class itself) or a pre-created instance of that class. This choice has significant implications for object instantiation and state management across your application.

---

#### 1. **Plain Old JavaScript Class (POJC) Pattern**

This is the most straightforward and traditional way to define and use classes.

*   **What it is:** You define a class, which serves as a blueprint or a factory for creating objects.
*   **What it exports:** The class definition itself.
*   **How to define it (Example `MyClass.js`):**
    ```javascript MyClass.js
    class MyClass {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }

      greet() {
        return `Hello from ${this.name}!`;
      }
    }

    export default MyClass; // Exporting the class blueprint
    ```
*   **How to use it (Example `App.js`):**
    ```javascript App.js
    import MyClass from './MyClass.js'; // Importing the class blueprint

    // To use MyClass, you MUST create an instance using 'new'
    const instanceA = new MyClass('Instance A');
    console.log(instanceA.greet()); // Output: Hello from Instance A!

    // Each 'new' call creates a completely separate instance
    const instanceB = new MyClass('Instance B');
    console.log(instanceB.greet()); // Output: Hello from Instance B!
    ```

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Instantiation:** You explicitly create new objects using the `new` keyword every time you need an instance of the class.
    *   **Instance Count:** Each `new` call produces a distinct, independent instance. You can have multiple instances of the same class, each with its own internal state.
    *   **State:** Instances do not inherently share state unless you design them to (e.g., via static properties or external data sources).
    *   **Use Cases:** Ideal for defining models (e.g., `User`, `Product`, `Order`), utility classes that manage specific, localized data, or any scenario where you need multiple, isolated objects of the same type.

#### 2. **Exporting an Instance (Singleton) Pattern**

This pattern leverages the JavaScript module system's caching behavior to ensure only one instance of a class exists throughout your entire application. It's often referred to as a "Singleton" pattern.

*   **What it is:** You define a class, then immediately create *one* instance of that class within the module, and export that pre-created instance.
*   **What it exports:** An *already instantiated object* (a single instance) of the class, not the class definition itself.
*   **How to define it (Example `MyService.js`):**
    ```javascript MyService.js
    class MyService {
      constructor() {
        this.counter = 0;
        console.log('MyService instance created!'); // This will log only once
      }

      increment() {
        this.counter++;
        return this.counter;
      }

      getCounter() {
        return this.counter;
      }
    }

    // Create ONE instance of MyService and export it
    export default new MyService();
    ```
*   **How to use it (Example `ComponentA.js` and `ComponentB.js`):**

    ```javascript ComponentA.js
    import MyService from './MyService.js'; // Importing the ONE pre-created instance

    console.log('ComponentA:', MyService.increment()); // Accessing methods directly
    console.log('ComponentA:', MyService.getCounter());
    ```

    ```javascript ComponentB.js
    import MyService from './MyService.js'; // Importing the SAME pre-created instance

    console.log('ComponentB:', MyService.increment());
    console.log('ComponentB:', MyService.getCounter());
    ```

    **Execution Flow and Output:**
    1.  `MyService.js` is loaded for the first time (e.g., when `ComponentA.js` imports it).
    2.  `new MyService()` is executed, creating `MyService` instance. `"MyService instance created!"` logs to console.
    3.  This single instance is cached by the module loader.
    4.  `ComponentA.js` receives this instance. `ComponentA: 1`, `ComponentA: 1` logs.
    5.  `ComponentB.js` imports `MyService`. The module loader provides the *cached, existing instance* from step 2/3. `new MyService()` is **not** executed again.
    6.  `ComponentB.js` receives the *exact same instance*. `ComponentB: 2`, `ComponentB: 2` logs.

*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Instantiation:** The `new` keyword is used *once* inside the service's own module (`MyService.js`). When other modules import it, they receive the already existing instance directly. You do **not** use `new` in the importing file.
    *   **Instance Count:** **Crucially, due to ES Module caching, there is only ONE single instance of the class created and shared across your entire application.** Every import statement referring to `MyService.js` will resolve to this same, cached instance.
    *   **State:** All modules that import this service share the same instance and therefore operate on its shared internal state. Changes made to the instance's properties in one part of the application will be visible in all other parts using the same instance.
    *   **Use Cases:** Ideal for services that manage global state, handle application-wide logic (like your `WalletService`, a `LoggerService`, `AuthenticationService`, database connection handlers, etc.), or any scenario where you specifically need only one central point of control for a particular functionality.

### **Summary of Differences**

| Feature              | Plain Old JavaScript Class (POJC)                  | Exporting an Instance (Singleton)         |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **What is Exported** | The `class` definition (the blueprint)             | A pre-created `instance` of the class     |
| **How to Use**       | `import MyClass from './MyClass.js';`<br>`const obj = new MyClass();` | `import myService from './MyService.js';`<br>`myService.method();` |
| **`new` Keyword**    | Required by the consumer for each instance         | Used *once* within the service's own module; consumers do **not** use `new`. |
| **Number of Instances**| Can create many independent instances across the application. | **Only one single instance exists across the entire application** due to ES Module caching. |
| **State Management** | Each instance has its own isolated state.          | All consumers share the same instance and its global state. |
| **Primary Use Case** | Data models, distinct objects.                     | Global services, shared resources, centralized logic. |

This detailed breakdown should provide a solid foundation for your documentation, clarifying the distinct behaviors and appropriate use cases for each pattern. Your `WalletService` example perfectly fits the "Exporting an Instance (Singleton)" pattern because you likely want all parts of your server to interact with the *same* wallet management logic and shared database connections without creating redundant service objects.
